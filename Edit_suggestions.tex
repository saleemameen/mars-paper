Page 3 - figure 2 (power) needs to be much larger or removed/dropped
in an appendix

Page 5 - figure 3+4 take up the page - should they be in an appendix/
are they readable etc.

Page 7 - 1.2.1 Bulk Materials - "producible on Mars in table ??" - ?? reference not loading?

Page 8 - the 3 images sitting together is odd - can we move the mining to 
the previous page so it sits under the correct section (and stops cluttering)

    - "Similarly, the iron powder is also refined throughiron carbonyl??to form pure iron powde" ?? reference not loading?

Page 16 - reference 4 is formatting wrongly (the misc long url one)
