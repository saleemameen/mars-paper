We have 30 mins total: 20-25 mins of speaking time, 5-10 mins questions.


    30 points technical design: What engineering systems will be used? How will they work?
    30 points economic: How can the city state be made economically successful?
    20 points social/cultural/political: What should Martian society be like? What kinds of schools, arts, sports and other activities should there be? How, given a fresh start, can life on Mars be made better than life on Earth? How should the city state govern itself?
    20 points aesthetic: How can the city state be made an attractive and enjoyable place to live?

2 major areas, 2 minor areas. so ~5 minutes per area. That's ~2-3 slides per area.

Here are some test slides.

A lot have more specific numbers than we have

Some have a "Staging/how it's built slide".
Some have a "here is the name/this is why it's chosen" slide

#People have also asked re. cost of setting it up as a common question - i have some slides on the economics?
#From zubrin - the key point is can it be economically self sustaining? So that's the larger question vs. actual costs. We're going to want some actual numbers somewhere.
#ie. SKA telescope is 2.3 billion USD construction cost, JWT is $4 billion usd.
# North america space launch services 4 billion + spacecraft manufacture (?)
# ML 390BN USD by 2025 - 10% for training, that's 40BN for quantum speedups.
# ZBLAN fiber replaces global fiber market ~billions
# 
Quantum computing needs to be at low temperatures - having electric isolation/cold environments offers a speed up to a 5 bn industry. 
Exporting materials - ZBLAN fiber production and export to earth, comparative advantage? Zero gravity production is easier. 
Exporting services - telescope services. 
James Web Telescope_space based can be improved on, ball-park $4bn+
Machine learning worth 390 BN by 2025 - we'd export quantum speedups - D-wave services to improve computational speed for earth-bound processes related to quantum ML.
Calcium alloys can be produced with no fire risk. 


Location slide: - Why did we choose this particular spot?
- Access to fresh water
- radiation shielding
- plentiful living space that's cheap and easy to excavate - Can grow in 3d space
- Heatsink for power production

Power: #This seems to be a common slide "Power/storage/etc".
Fast spectrum dual salt breeder reactor - Simplify as needed.
- Simple design - good neutronics making the design robust, high fuel burnup, no reprocessing needed
- Fuel pins cheap to import - not a radiological hazard/weapons restricted.
- Cryobattery doubles as cooling for fuel stores
- Mass produced locally manufactured turbines
- High temperature process heat for chemical industry
- Waste heat produces an artificial subglacial lake/habitat warming

Food: - this tends to be a big focus
Ditch farming - this is a novel concept, so we should have a slide.

Food 2:
Aquaponics in the subglacial lake. This can be a quick slide, but it's worth calling out. It's also similar to ditch farming, so it might end up on a combined slide.
- mass producible with modular construction
# How are they illuminated is a fairly common question

Maybe grass farms/hydroponics.

Materials:
- direct metal refining
- 3d printing/E beam printing
- Mass production of O2 from ore
- S/P extraction for biological cycle
- bulk bioplastics
- Show miners?
- Maybe show table 1?

one group had a "resource chain" slide

Technology:
- Zn/S/I cycle mass producing H2/CO/O2
- Biochemical processing cycle
- Xenotrophs and GMO's
- Use biological processes instead of complicated chemical processes

https://marspedia.org/Nuclear_food_cycle
"1kg uranium could be converted to approximately 850,000 person days of food"
If we include the $500/kg import cost, that's $0.0006/person day of imputed import cost. (Not counting plant cost, etc)

- GMO eggs/milk.

Life support: - some groups had a life support slide
Amine/ionic liquid CO2 scrubbers
Mass produced O2
Dehumidifiers
Biological waste recycling
TSSE water recycling


Society:

Societal ideals:
-Working towards the terraformed dome (Show terraformed crater)
- Value of hard work/education

#some groups had a more general "how does the government work" slide.
SAR:


Delegative democracy:
- World is too complex for every person to understand everything
- Everyone knows someone who knows more than than them in any particular field
- Scaleable version of direct democracy using cryptography

Policy:
- Produce large quantities of well educated children
- Encourage work
- Encourage immigration via actuarial incentives
- Encourage low crime, cheaper to spend on prevention than detention
- Evidence based society
- Show demographic pyramid?
- ES and genetic diversity #May be controversial 

Recreation: - Eye candy is always good.
Underwater beach slide

Architecture: #TODO we are weak on this.
- Initial dome slide
- Second slide with final terraformed crater (?)
- Combination of asthetics and ease of production.

#TODO do we split economics slide?
Local economics:
- Mining leases and development banks funding mining operations
- Land sales and the mortgage market funding "land production"
- Futures market for long term/short term production. ie. electrolysis vs. farming for O2 sales.
- Capital goods funded via sovereign wealth fund.
- Integration into UPU/international financial system, MBS/etc.
- Include government reinsurance/etc?

#Should we move this earlier, as it's a major differentiator, and something that gets asked fairly often.
#This might be foreign trade?
#Maybe a slide on "how are you going to raise money to pay for this? Including information on the synthetic financial products and the like.

Economics: - This is something nobody had, so this is a step up.
- FDI
- Futures market for interplanetary trade to stabalise prices for bulk trade
- Leased rockets driving down the cost per kg to mars
- Export of financial products to earth
- Base for asteroid mining
- Export of fuel to LEO
- Export of biomass to commercial outposts on the south pole of the moon, specifically P/S, C.
- Substitute market from earth (Large scale telescopes, sat production, rockets, space probes, etc)
- Unique market (Dwave style Quantum computers, ZBLAN optic fiber, reactive superalloys, etc)
#TODO work out the C input from the moon society lecture required for selling CH4
#Might need at least a ballpark cost figure

Extra slides

#There was a question about after death things
- Default being cremation/burial at sea

#There was a question about post productive people
- Demographic slide, include soverign wealth fund/super system. Maybe a
